HTML/CSS Module
EVENT CENTER WEBSITE submission

I'm not entirely sure how to do these README files. So, please let me know if this could use more information, better formatting, etc. Thanks!

Overall Project:
    I found this project pretty fun and not too overly challenging. The biggest challenges I had was trying to style the page correctly so that when it was rezied, everrything fit properly. I used basic HTML and CSS, nothing overly complicated. The biggest thing I probably learned is how to troubleshoot and research to get the page to do what you want. I found myself googling or sifting through lessons to find the proper code or selectors to use. A lot of trial and error. Overall, I'm very happy with my project. I had learned a little HTML/CSS through freeCodeCamp prior to these modules. But I had never done anything this intensive. First ever website...CHECK!

Home Page:
    Basic layout, hero/banner image at the top. Had a little trouble sizing properly and had to play with different images and selectors to get it laid out the way that I wanted. This page definetly took the longest just getting the basic structure lined out, media queries, etc.

Events Page:
    Pretty much just copy and pasted the events section that I made for the home page and added it here. With the addition of a little calendar picture.

Menu Page:
    Basic table format. Had to figure out how to make the main heading span two rows, and how to do striped columns. Turned out pretty cool!

Location Page:
    Embedded a google map via iframe code. Added some hours and a phone number and then centered everything. I started noticing that the css I had wrote when doing the home page was starting to translate over the things.

Contact Page:
    Basic form. Had to play around a bit with the css to get it to look properly. Used fieldsets to better organize things.

Conclusion:
    I think my website hits all of the grading requirements. I am a little ocd and adhd so I wanted to make sure my code was very easy to follow. I used section elements, article elements, divs, etc. I definetly think that everything looks nice and neat and is easy to follow. Happy with the outcome.
